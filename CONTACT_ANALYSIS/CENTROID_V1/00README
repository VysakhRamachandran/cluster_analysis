Centroid selection, try 1

mai.sh: master script


* extract_centroid_clusters.sh
    - What it does: for each complex, select representative of each cluster 
    - input: ../Interfaces_1FFW.pkl $CLUSTER_FILES_PATH/clusters_1FFW.txt
    - calls: Compute_contacts_frequency_in_clusters_and_extract_centroids.py 
            representive snapshot is the one with the contact vector most similar to the cluster contact vector:
            score= Scalar product between the snapshot frequency vector (binary values) and the cluster frequency vector (real values)
            in each cluster, the snapshot with the highest score is selected.
# in each cluster, selection of the snapshot with the maximum score
